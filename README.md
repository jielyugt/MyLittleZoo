# MyLittleZoo - a HackGT 5 Project

# Inspiration
You are hanging out with your friends and they just keep looking at their phone. You don't even have to imagine it because it is happening every day. Thousands of engineers in silicon valley are working day and night to deprive your of attention from real life, and it's time to fight back.

# What it does
MyLittleZoo is a virtual zoo in your phone. Every time you hit "focus" and leave your phone untouched for the time period you set, you get a new animal in your zoo. You can also "connect" with your friend while you and your friends are hanging out, so your animals are also playing with their animals, and if no one touches the phone in that period of time, animals will be exchanged!

# How we built it
The whole app is made in unity.

# Challenges we ran into
Time is tight so we did not get to finish all the functionality. New features will come out in the near future.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team learnt C# throughout the weekend.

# What we learned
Some seemingly small tasks can cost far more time than the estimation

# What's next for MyLittleZoo
New features will come out in the near future. Another game mode will be introduced that will allow users to socialize with other players without touching their phone. A different incentive will be introduced; instead of increasing the number of animals, users can level up their animal. This change will not only encourage users to have face to face conversations but also allows people to have a more balanced social and work life, as maxing out the account requires dedication to both game modes.
